To-Do:


Overall
-------

	• Lobby Connectivity
		• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
		• Friend Invites (Out of Scope)
	• New Lobby UI
		• Lobby Chat
	• Handle more than 6 players (12? unlimited?)

    • In Game Chat

    • Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)


Co-op
-------

	Nice to Have
		• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked
		• should be able to see chosen character in coop UI

		• New Death/Victory Screen with live results
		• Co-op Boss Choice mechanic
			• Two bosses available for the first player
			• Second player gets what the first didn't choose

	Additional Coop Mechanics:
		• Redo all events so that they give you an option of improving your own run or other player runs, or penalties for you or others
		• Empty rooms feel bad T_T. Is there some way of making them feel better?

	Coop Relic ideas:
		• Using a potion uses it for everyone (and the effect queue up for the next battle)
		• fighting an enemy someone else has defeated gives you a bonus (+1 str per player who defeated it?)


Versus
-------

	Should Have
		• Reporting to remote server
			• Online Leaderboard
				• Times
				• Run History
				• Ladder/Skill ranking

	Nice to Have
		• Give a neow bonus based on how far you got if you die on non-ironman, eg card picks and gold for every 5 floors survived. To accelerate the climb!

		• Scroll bars for unlimited participants, NetworkHelper.CreateLobby max increase
		• Splits on death screen on widget hover
		• Run History on death screen on widget hover
		• More information about competitor builds in Widget might be nice (this also offers limited rubber banding - boss relics at least?)

		• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
		• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget


Bugs
-------

To Test:

Lobby and Game Creation



Coop

• Potion Relic needs to account for potion belts grabbed afterwards
• Potion Relic needs to aggregate existing potions


Versus

• On versus mode screen, the times of players are sometimes listed as the same after finishing a run
• Courier in Versus Act 4



Any Game

• sorting people with times is descending instead of ascending




Outstanding:

• Timer does not stay when you retry
• Lobby doesn't disband when you quit the game from the lobby screen (really annoying)

• When the owner changes, the embark button doesn't appear
• Inviting to join the game doesn't seem to work at all, it makes a new lobby with no one. Both inviting and joining manually don't work

• In versus for some reason the 6th player added does not show up (but will once the 7th is added)
• Deck Button goes brr noise on custom screens, but works now


• Map names don't show up beside the nodes very well
	- also map names not adjust for different scren sizes







Out of scope:

• Versus mode additional Neow bonuses based on how far you made it before you retry

• Locked Rooms can occasionally cause crashes at the beginning of an act if people go too quick or use debug jumps? before the map is loaded?
• Tiny House ruins the boss select screen if you click too fast
• If players are too fast, they can both choose option

• Splits on death screen hover
• could instant jump to the Act Boss in Coop without taking a normal path

Co-op Relic ideas:

	Hunting Knives
		For each teammate who has started a combat with an enemy before you, that enemies loses 5% HP at the start of battle.




To-Do:


• Mirror Touch should only recover HP after bosses when the last person passes the bosses.
• Bonds of Fate doesn't work with Omamori

• Dimensioneel's randomness needs to be tested/improved?
• Dimensioneel could be changed to better distribute the relics, and allow you to get rid of any you don't want instead of 3.

• If you die to the 3rd boss in Versus to the heart, it shows you as the winner 

• Do some profiling and see if there are issues you can smooth out performance-wise.
• Save and Quit button still sometimes says 'Save and Quit' -> It should never say save and quit

• Boss relic skip doesn't work.

• Mirror Touch and Mark of Bloom might have dying softlock issues.



• Improve the death screen! See below

(Improve the death screen stack)
• Starting a run in Versus Mode, then switching to Coop Mode and dying brings up the timer instead of the health and gold on the "End of the Road" screen.
• on heart runs it stops time when you win to act 3 bosses with no keys
• Show a player's deck/relic summary on mouseover
• Splits on death screen hover
• End of game versus screen should have a scroll bar so you can see everyone's results
• If you reach the last boss and someone can still recall to get you past the heart, wait until they do or don't
• What happens when someone doesn't have the keys to get to the heart? Feels weird.






- receive a relic from courier, then send the same relic, it sends your new one not the old one.


Won't do yet:

• Extra coop relics x1
• Versus improvements for speedrunners - solo speedrun, storing splits, PBs, seed comparisons for unseeded
• default profile picture for individuals in place of steam, spire with friends logo? The holdy hands friends?
• Finish Coop non-stacking vanilla relics
• Change Preserved Insect, Boot, Prayer Wheel descriptions to reflect stacking copies...?

• Ultrawide monitors have big issues on layout for map and courier
• Courier drops items when you leave the reward window, but should clear the rewards when you leave the Courier room instead
• Can send bottles or bottled cards with courier - these interactions surely work poorly.... or do they?

• Custom mode menu's y value needs to be setting scaled

• Dimensional wallet doesn't always sync money correctly
• I cant proceed after taking Big House
• Blue Ladder uses up wing boots charges T_T

• Floor related things such as relic availability or Mind Bloom or Portal to Boss probably don't work right anymore.
• Brush size Persist between runs as a feature

• Why not add some pre-drawn 'stamps' that can be added to the map via drawing?

• Neow will cause a crash if the number of players drops between having the options presented and selecting them.

• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options, causing a softlock

• Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)

• Add a map trail toggle so that other player's map trail aren't obnoxious
• Improvements to RAINBOW title fire
• Event panels draw overtop of team stats

• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget (Versus)

• bug report: i abandoned a match in spire with friends and then switched profiles and my game crashed



Out of scope:

• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
• Lobby Chat
• In Game Chat

• Tiny House ruins the boss select screen if you click too fast
• The game softlocks if you open the team relic chest before getting a curse from a bell.
• Floor 50+ retry bonus might fail if basemod merge daily mods setting is turned off

• Run History doesn't show team relics
• There are lag issues with Mirror Touch and probably other shared relics (eg. one player gets hurt while the other loses max hp), can fix this by doing the differential instead of absolute value
• Random button for character select

• Coop Boss Choice - players get to choose their boss, earlier players choose first. Might be nice, since you could adjust at courier for who to fight who.

• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked

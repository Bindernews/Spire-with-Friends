To-Do:


Overall
-------

	• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
	• Lobby Chat
    • In Game Chat
    • Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)

Co-op
-------

	Nice to Have
		• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked

		• New Death/Victory Screen with live results
		• Co-op Boss Choice mechanic
			• Two bosses available for the first player
			• Second player gets what the first didn't choose

	Additional Coop Mechanics:
		• Redo all events so that they give you an option of improving your own run or other player runs, or penalties for you or others

	Coop Relic ideas:
		• Some sort of share card deck or share card picks relic (Ghost Writer Replacement?)
		• Message in a Bottle - everyone bottles a card, one of those cards is added to your opening hand
		• Instantly remove 3 cards from your deck and send a draft of those three to each other player via the Courier.
		
		• fighting an enemy someone else has defeated gives you a bonus (+1 str per player who defeated it?)
		• Courier gets more choices, or something coolers (sell/transfer energy? Boss relics? Max health? etc?)
		• Courier instead lets you BUY things from other players
		• Courier duplicates things, or cand send duplicates?
		• Courier sells 'improvements', or upgrades to relics, or something along those lines
		• “everyone chooses a different bonus”
		• Courier sends things instantly


Versus
-------

	Should Have
		• Reporting to remote server
			• Online Leaderboard
				• Times
				• Run History
				• Ladder/Skill ranking

	Nice to Have
		• Splits on death screen on widget hover
		• Run History on death screen on widget hover
		• More information about competitor builds in Widget might be nice (this also offers limited rubber banding - boss relics at least?)

		• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
		• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget


Bugs
-------

Blue ladder let Zero and I go to lateral nodes that the other was currently in, not sure if intended


Outstanding:

• Revamp Ghost Writer

• The drawings don't match depending on the screen resolution... or possibly they are offset from the bottom?






• Patreon Custom mode access to Versus and Coop
• Extra coop relics x2







Later stuff:

• Modded character select

• In case of errors or disconnections, need to be able to unlock rooms somehow. That way players don't get stuck. Maybe on checking valid connections, look to see if there are any RemotePlayers currently in the room? This is also a valid way to check for room locking actually... derp

• Versus improvements for speedrunners - solo speedrun, storing splits, PBs, seed comparisons for unseeded

• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options, causing a softlock

• Ultrawide monitors have big issues on layout for map and courier
• Event panels draw overtop of team stats
• Make a force reconnect button in the topbar to attempt to rejoin the last lobby (also attempt to sync your player data....? This part is big oof)
• Make the Map Draw Palette center align everything
• Add a map trail toggle so that other player's map trail aren't obnoxious

• Dimensional wallet doesn't always sync money correctly
• Mirror Touch's description and results don't appear to match up for some reason

• Improvements to RAINBOW title fire
• Can send bottles or bottled cards with courier - these interactions surely work poorly.... or do they?
• Can I think of a better approach than Strings of Fate max hp loss?

• Floor related things such as relic availability or Mind Bloom or Portal to Boss probably don't work right anymore.


(Improve the death screen stack)
• Starting a run in Versus Mode, then switching to Coop Mode and dying brings up the timer instead of the health and gold on the "End of the Road" screen.
• on heart runs it stops time when you win to act 3 bosses with no keys
• Show a player's deck/relic summary on mouseover
• Splits on death screen hover
• End of game versus screen should have a scroll bar so you can see everyone's results

• A bug we encountered with vapor funnel is that when the potions are used in the boss fight just before, we get them back when we take the funnel.

• After creating a new lobby you can very quickly press on "embark", which crashes the game
• JAX was not upgraded with pneumatic post


Out of scope:

• Tiny House ruins the boss select screen if you click too fast
• Floor 50+ retry bonus might fail if basemod merge daily mods setting is turned off
• Sometimes instead of dying players just get 'stuck'

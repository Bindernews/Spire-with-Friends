Co-op Relic ideas:

	Hunting Knives
		For each teammate who has started a combat with an enemy before you, that enemies loses 5% HP at the start of battle.

	Something that increases the floor density?

	Click and drag to swap/rearrange map nodes, once per act per person.

	Dimensioneel replacement??? -> Offer two random relics you can give to other players at the courier (at a higher price?)
								-> Relic Dolly Mirror


To-Do:

• Blue Ladder changes 
	-> Increases the number of nodes next Act. Possible new relic instead? Architect Kit?
	-> Players behind the leader have flight. Leader(s) if 4/5/6 players?

• Mirror Touch should only recover HP after bosses when the last person passes the bosses.
• Pneumatic post should probably not give a discount.

• Dimensioneel's randomness needs to be tested/improved?
• Dimensioneel could be changed to better distribute the relics, and allow you to get rid of any you don't want instead of 3.
• Dimensioneel option -> Reroll all non-boss relics, BUT you get to choose your set as a team (by clicking on a relic in the screen to select it in your colour, with the selection being exclusive). This sounds strong but also people are very loss averse so maybe it feels terrible?

• Maybe try out the huge health heart and team heart kills?

• If you die to the 3rd boss in Versus to the heart, it shows you as the winner 

• Do some profiling and see if there are issues you can smooth out performance-wise.
• Save and Quit button still sometimes says 'Save and Quit' -> It should never say save and quit

• Boss relic skip doesn't work.

• Mirror Touch and Mark of Bloom might have dying softlock issues.
• Full deck screen for other players by clicking on their widget?

• Custom character relic upgrade crashes
• Custom character class specific relic is no good either
• Replay the Spire bug, fix is in Discord chat

• Consider making Orrery/Cauldron work right with Courier

• Honk button

• A display for keys

• Big House with Mirror Touch doesn't give +5 per person, only +5 total

• the double/extra/lower/hidden encounter should be available to the next player who wants to visit that location, rather than making the next player wait for the previ

• Random Character button

• In versus the retry gives different card rewards?

• Move the Node names to below the node, make them move with hover as well?
• Might be bugs clicking Deck/Map/Settings on the RaceEnd screen?
• In Versus, after dying, got Lament only but no Neow bonus

• Player decks don't update properly with transmutations.

• Deck screen softlock on boss relic also happens with Dimensioneel as well as Message in Bottle
• Improve the death screen! See below

(Improve the death screen stack)
• Starting a run in Versus Mode, then switching to Coop Mode and dying brings up the timer instead of the health and gold on the "End of the Road" screen.
• on heart runs it stops time when you win to act 3 bosses with no keys
• Show a player's deck/relic summary on mouseover
• Splits on death screen hover
• End of game versus screen should have a scroll bar so you can see everyone's results
• If you reach the last boss and someone can still recall to get you past the heart, wait until they do or don't
• What happens when someone doesn't have the keys to get to the heart? Feels weird.



- receive a relic from courier, then send the same relic, it sends your new one not the old one. Real sad.


Won't do yet:

• Extra coop relics x1
• Versus improvements for speedrunners - solo speedrun, storing splits, PBs, seed comparisons for unseeded
• default profile picture for individuals in place of steam, spire with friends logo? The holdy hands friends?
• Finish Coop non-stacking vanilla relics
• Change Preserved Insect, Boot, Prayer Wheel descriptions to reflect stacking copies...?

• Ultrawide monitors have big issues on layout for map and courier
• Courier drops items when you leave the reward window, but should clear the rewards when you leave the Courier room instead
• Can send bottles or bottled cards with courier - these interactions surely work poorly.... or do they?

• Custom mode menu's y value needs to be setting scaled

• Dimensional wallet doesn't always sync money correctly
• I cant proceed after taking Big House
• Blue Ladder uses up wing boots charges T_T

• Floor related things such as relic availability or Mind Bloom or Portal to Boss probably don't work right anymore.
• Brush size Persist between runs as a feature

• Why not add some pre-drawn 'stamps' that can be added to the map via drawing?

• Neow will cause a crash if the number of players drops between having the options presented and selecting them.

• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options, causing a softlock

• Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)

• Add a map trail toggle so that other player's map trail aren't obnoxious
• Improvements to RAINBOW title fire
• Event panels draw overtop of team stats

• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget (Versus)

• bug report: i abandoned a match in spire with friends and then switched profiles and my game crashed



Out of scope:

• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
• Lobby Chat
• In Game Chat

• Tiny House ruins the boss select screen if you click too fast
• The game softlocks if you open the team relic chest before getting a curse from a bell.
• Floor 50+ retry bonus might fail if basemod merge daily mods setting is turned off

• Run History doesn't show team relics
• There are lag issues with Mirror Touch and probably other shared relics (eg. one player gets hurt while the other loses max hp), can fix this by doing the differential instead of absolute value
• Random button for character select

• Coop Boss Choice - players get to choose their boss, earlier players choose first. Might be nice, since you could adjust at courier for who to fight who.

• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked
• Smoke bomb should leave the enemy and the health

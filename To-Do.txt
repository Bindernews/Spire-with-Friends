To-Do:


Overall
-------

	• Lobby Connectivity
		• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
		• Friend Invites (Out of Scope)
	• New Lobby UI
		• Lobby Chat
		• Handle ownership change
		• Handle room closure
		• Handle kicking
	• Handle more than 6 players (12? unlimited?)

    • In Game Chat

    • Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)


Co-op
-------

	Should Have
		• Shared Deaths should function properly, with feedback

	Nice to Have
		• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked

	• New Death/Victory Screen with live results
	• Co-op Boss Choice mechanic
		• Two bosses available for the first player
		• Second player gets what the first didn't choose

	Additional Coop Mechanics:
		• Redo all events so that they give you an option of improving your own run or other player runs, or penalties for you or others
		• You need one set of keys per player, but the keys don't disappear until you gather all of them. So one player could get 6 keys in a 2p game, and that would work fine.


Versus
-------

	Should Have
		• Reporting to remote server
			• Online Leaderboard
				• Times
				• Run History
				• Ladder/Skill ranking

	Nice to Have
		• Give a neow bonus based on how far you got if you die on non-ironman, eg card picks and gold for every 5 floors survived. To accelerate the climb!

		• Scroll bars for unlimited participants, NetworkHelper.CreateLobby max increase
		• Splits on death screen on widget hover
		• Run History on death screen on widget hover
		• More information about competitor builds in Widget might be nice (this also offers limited rubber banding - boss relics at least?)

		• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
		• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget


Bugs
-------

• Empty Room Chest needs a custom image
• Team boss relic needs a custom image
• Mirror Touch does shitty things as single player, doesn't change current HP either
• Death isn't working again. Crashes on death.
• Save patching still sometimes overwrites existing saves, gives a 0 on spirits
• When someone joins they propagate rules and it's wrong
• Transformey cards did not actually transform


• Seeds did not match. Also, we were unable to select the team relic

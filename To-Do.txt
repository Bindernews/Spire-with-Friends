Bugs
-------

• Non-host had an extra player in their players list
• MainLobbyScreen has some UI issues, especially with playerList
• NewGameScreen has UI issues with the character select not appearing in the right place
• When dying, you do not die but instead stay at 0 health
• When dying, the information shown is always mistaken
• Splits textures get 'disposed', I need to load them in by the key myself

To-Do:


Overall
-------

	• Lobby Connectivity
		• Lobby Filtering and Search (Out of Scope)
		• Friend Invites (Out of Scope)
	• New Lobby UI
		• Lobby Chat
	• Handle more than 6 players (12? unlimited?)

    • In Game Chat

    • Players can choose their own configurable colour (Out of Scope)


Co-op
-------

	Nice to Have
		• Neow choices are bad for the last player, no indication you are sharing choices, no indication of what the others picked
		• should be able to see chosen character in coop UI

		• New Death/Victory Screen with live results
		• Co-op Boss Choice mechanic
			• Two bosses available for the first player
			• Second player gets what the first didn't choose

	Additional Coop Mechanics:
		• Redo all events so that they give you an option of improving your own run or other player runs, or penalties for you or others
		• Empty rooms feel bad T_T. Is there some way of making them feel better?

	Coop Relic ideas:
		• Using a potion uses it for everyone (and the effect queue up for the next battle)
		• fighting an enemy someone else has defeated gives you a bonus (+1 str per player who defeated it?)


Versus
-------

	Should Have
		• Reporting to remote server
			• Online Leaderboard
				• Times
				• Run History
				• Ladder/Skill ranking

	Nice to Have
		• Give a neow bonus based on how far you got if you die on non-ironman, eg card picks and gold for every 5 floors survived. To accelerate the climb!

		• Splits on death screen on widget hover
		• Run History on death screen on widget hover
		• More information about competitor builds in Widget might be nice (this also offers limited rubber banding - boss relics at least?)

		• Top Panel timer shifts positions, which is a little awkward
		• Indication of the number of deaths on the player widget


Bugs
-------

To Test:

• Shouldn't be any more disconnects on player join
√ Fire is now over the 'i' in friends
√ Jump to final boss bug
√ Calling Bell Boss Swap soft lock

• Map Button was not available on Courier, Team Relic Select, or Race End screens
• Clicking a Top Panel button on Team Relic Select screen would cause a softlock
• Vapor Funnel potion slots don't correctly rearrange themselves until the start of next act
• Fixed a bug where loading in without ascension mode unlocked could cause crashes
• Fixed a bug where different levels of unlocks in your savefile would cause Seed desyncing
• Ghost Writer should now only affect cards in your deck
• Ghost Writer no longer sends to only the same player
• Vapor Funnel should no longer cause crashes
• Player colours should now always be unique
• Remove a rare crashing bug involving the game attempting to save Neow bonus information for some users
• Node outlines now split the colours into bars instead of stacking
• Player names on the map should be better aligned
• Disconnected players won't disappear - instead they will show disconnected unless finished the run
• Fixed a bug that could cause crashes on returning to the main menu
• Coop maps now become more dense the more players are in the game.
• Burning Elites in Coop will now be set at twice the act number, or the number of players who need keys, whatever is lower
• The player HUD no longer draws overtop of the energy indicator
• When more than seven players are present, a summary of your placing is visible


Outstanding:

• Kicking a player will crash their game
• My friend sent me orery via courrier, and I when I picked the relic, it did the sound that you picked again and again and again, and the popup to take cards showed up and had an insane amount of cards
• My friend sent me Cauldron via courrier, it did the same as orrery

• Versus mode additional Neow bonuses based on how far you made it before you retry
• Map Paint :)
• Splits on death screen hover

• Walking into the tile which had an empty slot previously taken by a courier contained an empty room reward sack, which when opened crashed the players game.
• Character names and player names don't support utf, and also the character name isn't localized but sends the source player's language

• Vapor Funnel sometimes discards potions (even though the potion IDs match)
• The player bar will overlap with the act 3 boss defeat message.




Out of scope:

• In versus for some reason the 6th player added does not show up (but will once the 7th is added) (line 82 PlayerListWidget.java)
• Locked Rooms can occasionally cause crashes at the beginning of an act if people go too quick or use debug jumps? before the map is loaded?
• Tiny House ruins the boss select screen if you click too fast
• If players are too fast, they can both choose the same Neow options
